Credit Card Fraud Detection
A machine learning project to classify credit card transactions as fraudulent or genuine. The project uses Python and public datasets to demonstrate hands-on data science and model deployment skills.

Project Overview
This repository contains code and resources to build a credit card fraud detection system using machine learning techniques. The notebook covers:

1.Data loading and exploration
2.Visualization of transaction and class imbalances
3.Preprocessing and scaling
4.Handling imbalanced data (e.g., SMOTE/undersampling)
5.Model training (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, etc.)
6.Model evaluation with ROC-AUC, F1-score, confusion matrix
